1. **RESTful API Design** : Adhere to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) for designing web APIs, including resource identification, statelessness, uniform interface, and layered system architecture.
2. **OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)** : Utilize OpenAPI Specification for defining RESTful APIs, enabling standardization, documentation, and interoperability across different platforms and programming languages.
3. **OAuth 2.0** : Implement OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authorization, enabling delegated access to resources without sharing user credentials and facilitating single sign-on (SSO) authentication flows.
4. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** : Use JWT as a standard for securely transmitting information between parties in JSON format, commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.
5. **Microservices Architecture** : Adopt a microservices architectural style for developing large, complex applications as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business domain or functionality.
6. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** : Design systems using an event-driven approach where components communicate through asynchronous events, enabling decoupling, scalability, and flexibility in handling business processes and workflows.
7. **Containerization with Docker** : Standardize application packaging and deployment using Docker containers, enabling consistent environments across development, testing, and production, and facilitating scalability and portability.
8. **Kubernetes** : Utilize Kubernetes as a container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, providing resilience, scalability, and operational efficiency.
9. **GraphQL** : Adopt GraphQL as a query language for APIs, enabling clients to request only the data they need and reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data, improving performance and developer productivity.
10. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** : Apply domain-driven design principles and patterns for modeling complex business domains, fostering collaboration between domain experts and developers and ensuring alignment between software and business requirements.

These architectural standards provide guidelines and best practices for designing, developing, and deploying software systems, promoting interoperability, scalability, security, and maintainability
