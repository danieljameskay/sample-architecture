1. **Modularity** : Design systems with components that can be easily separated and recombined, promoting flexibility and scalability.
2. **Simplicity** : Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary complexity to enhance clarity, maintainability, and ease of understanding.
3. **Scalability** : Design systems that can handle increased loads or expansion without requiring major restructuring, ensuring adaptability to changing demands.
4. **Security by Design** : Integrate security measures at every stage of development to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.
5. **Loose Coupling** : Minimize dependencies between components to reduce the impact of changes, enhance maintainability, and facilitate independent development and deployment.
6. **High Cohesion** : Ensure that elements within a module or component are closely related and serve a single, well-defined purpose, promoting clarity and ease of maintenance.
7. **Resilience** : Design systems to gracefully handle failures and disruptions, incorporating redundancy, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms to maintain availability and performance.
8. **Performance Optimization** : Optimize system performance through efficient resource utilization, caching, and other techniques to minimize response times and enhance user experience.
9. **Accessibility** : Ensure that systems are usable by individuals with disabilities, conforming to accessibility standards and guidelines to provide equal access to all users.
10. **Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)** : Implement automated processes for integrating code changes and delivering software updates frequently and reliably, promoting agility, quality, and collaboration in software development and deployment.

These principles serve as guidelines for architects and developers to make informed decisions and create robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
