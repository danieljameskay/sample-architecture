Sure! Below is a high-level design for an application architecture that interacts with a WebSocket from an external API, writes that data to Kafka, and another application that consumes data from Kafka and exposes an API to a frontend:

### Components Description:

1. **External API (Source)**:

   - The external API from which data is retrieved via WebSocket.
2. **WebSocket Consumer (Producer)**:

   - Connects to the WebSocket provided by the external API.
   - Consumes data from the WebSocket stream and sends it to the Kafka cluster.
3. **Kafka Cluster**:

   - Distributed event streaming platform for storing and processing real-time data.
   - Receives data from the WebSocket consumer and persists it in Kafka topics.
4. **Consumer Application (Sink)**:

   - Consumes data from Kafka topics.
   - Processes the data and exposes it via an API to be consumed by other applications.
5. **Frontend API (Client)**:

   - An API endpoint exposed to the frontend for retrieving data.
   - Consumes data from the consumer application and serves it to the frontend client.

### Workflow:

1. The WebSocket consumer connects to the WebSocket provided by the external API and starts consuming data.
2. Data received from the WebSocket is sent to the Kafka cluster, where it's stored in Kafka topics.
3. The consumer application consumes data from Kafka topics, processes it (if needed), and exposes it via an API.
4. The frontend API provides an endpoint for the frontend client to access the processed data.
5. The frontend client makes requests to the frontend API to fetch the data and presents it to the user.

### Benefits:

- **Scalability**: Each component can be scaled independently to handle increasing load.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Kafka ensures fault tolerance by replicating data across nodes in the cluster.
- **Real-time Processing**: Data is processed and made available to the frontend in near real-time.
- **Decoupling**: Each component is loosely coupled, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.

This architecture enables building real-time applications that can consume data from external sources, process it, and serve it to frontend clients efficiently.
